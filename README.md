# Angular4-Skeleton
Start building Angular4 applications immediately
Angular4 application skeleton with node expressjs backend

### Prerequisites

Must have node and npm installed


### How to use

Install node dependencies in your project root directory (this is where the 'package.json' file is located) using:
```sh
$ npm install
``` 
If you use typescript 2.0 or higher no need to install typescript definitons with typings. Moved to npm/@types.

Start application with 
```sh
$ gulp
```

Wait untill application is fully compiled and backend server is started (notified by message).

Navigate to 
```
http://localhost:3000/index.html
```
to start application. If everything is ok the message *Angular 4.0.1* will appear.
